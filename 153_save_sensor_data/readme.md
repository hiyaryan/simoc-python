This is a script that combines sensor reading with interpolation.
It generates subdirectories for raw and interpolated sensor data. 
The next step after this script is to write another script that can take
sensor data, either from CSV or direct from the sensors, and JSONize it.
From there, it will just be to send it to the front end.
