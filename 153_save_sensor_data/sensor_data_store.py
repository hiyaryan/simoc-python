# Variables to enhance precision of sensor

# Temperature Offset - Ideally you should have a temperature sensor that is
# independent of this sensor since this sensor generates heat as it is used
# The temperature offset is the difference between ambient temperature and
# the onboard temperature sensor. T_offset = Tscd_30 - Treferefence
# set with scd.temperature_offset = OFFSET_VALUE. Every tick is 0.01*C (uint16)
# Uses last value set before repowering.

# There are also methods for calibration of the sensor but since they come 
# calibrated it might not be good to change unless you have a sensor to compare
# it against or have the right environment for autocalibration (requires access
# to fresh air, and 5 days).

# The measurement interval can be changed with this, but it still seems to take 
# measurements at random time intervals just can be set "close" to this 
# interval. The fastest interval combined with interpolation or just most recent
# reading seems like the best way to me.
# Can be increased to make a recent reading closer to another time step if 
# we tried to synchronize it. Interpolation can be done either before data is 
# saved or after data is retrieved from storage but prior to packaging in JSON.
