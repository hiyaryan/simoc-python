# I. BACKGROUND
# IF A DEF BLOCK CONTAINS A 'yield', THE FUNCTION IS AUTOMATICALLY CONSIDERED A GENERATOR FUNCTION
# This is because Generators generate values and uses 'yield' to do so, rather than 'return'. Generators make iterations easy, 
# as you don't have to spend time implementing a specific iterator class, or keep track of states and timeout.
# In it's primary use, a genorator will return an iterator object which we can iterate over easily.


# II. GENERAL SYNTAX AND USE
