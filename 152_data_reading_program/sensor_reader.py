# This script is used to gather data from the SCD-30 sensor attached to
# the MCP-2221. This script is influenced by Carter Nelson and
# Bryan Siepert's scripts written for Adafruit Industries in 2020 and 2021
# It enhances these scripts by calling the linux export statement directly,
# By presenting the data much more cleanly
# by having a discrete function to reset the SCD and calling this function
# when necessary when the SCD-30 crashes (which happens sometimes)
# and also by recovering from failure to read from the SCD-30
# by trying again next time instead of just crashing altogether.
# Unfortunately, there is still a problem where the sensor stops working
# eventually and must be unplugged from the computer and plugged back in
# again to make it work.
