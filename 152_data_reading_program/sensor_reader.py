# This script is used to gather data from the SCD-30 sensor attached to
# the MCP-2221. This script is influenced by Carter Nelson and
# Bryan Siepert's scripts written for Adafruit Industries in 2020 and 2021
# It enhances these scripts by calling the linux export statement directly,
# By avoiding any kind of scd.reset() or alternative method which crashes
# the sensor, and by recovering from failure to read from the SCD-30
# by trying again next time instead of just crashing altogether.
# This script has allowed me to continuously run the sensor for over 8 hours
# as opposed to the one they provide which crashes in a few minutes
# and the alternate reset method they propose which tends to crash
# in about 30 minutes.

# Temperature Offset - Ideally you should have a temperature sensor that is
# independent of this sensor since this sensor generates heat as it is used
# The temperature offset is the difference between ambient temperature and
# the onboard temperature sensor. T_offset = Tscd_30 - Treferefence
# set with scd.temperature_offset = OFFSET_VALUE. Every tick is 0.01*C (uint16)
# Uses last value set before repowering.

# There are also methods for calibration of the sensor but since they come calibrated
# it might not be good to change unless you have a sensor to compare it against or
# have the right environment for autocalibration (requires access to fresh air, and 5 days).

# of 50 Khz due to "Clock Stretching".

# The scd.reset() method is known to cause issues with the MCP-2221
# A script written by Adafruit offered an alternative reset method
# but it also caused issues after testing, so it is best never to
# invoke the reset method.

# Alitude, set with with scd.altitude = ALTITUDE (uint16, height above sea level in meters)
# Seting altitude is disregarded when ambient pressure is given to the system.
# Ambient Pressure, set with scd.ambient_pressure = PRESSURE_VALUE. Default
# value is 1013.25 mBar   uint16 700 to 1400 range, 0 sets to default.

# The measurement interval can be changed with this, but it still seems to take measurements
# at random time intervals just can be set "close" to this interval. The fastest interval
# combined with interpolation or just most recent reading seems like the best way to me.
# Can be increased to make a recent reading closer to another time step if we tried
# to synchronize it. Interpolation can be done either before data is saved or after
# data is retrieved from storage but prior to packaging in JSON.
