# This script is used to gather data from the SCD-30 sensor attached to
# the MCP-2221. This script is influenced by Carter Nelson and
# Bryan Siepert's scripts written for Adafruit Industries in 2020 and 2021
# It enhances these scripts by calling the linux export statement directly,
# By avoiding any kind of scd.reset() or alternative method which crashes
# the sensor, and by recovering from failure to read from the SCD-30
# by trying again next time instead of just crashing altogether.
# This script has allowed me to continuously run the sensor for over 8 hours
# as opposed to the one they provide which crashes in a few minutes
# and the alternate reset method they propose which tends to crash
# in about 30 minutes.

# Temperature Offset - Ideally you should have a temperature sensor that is
# independent of this sensor since this sensor generates heat as it is used
# The temperature offset is the difference between ambient temperature and
# the onboard temperature sensor. T_offset = Tscd_30 - Treferefence
# set with scd.temperature_offset = OFFSET_VALUE. Every tick is 0.01*C (uint16)
# Uses last value set before repowering.

# There are also methods for calibration of the sensor but since they come calibrated
# it might not be good to change unless you have a sensor to compare it against or
# have the right environment for autocalibration (requires access to fresh air, and 5 days).
