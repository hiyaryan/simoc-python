Since the first changes were ma
Changes implemented per suggestions (even if just hints that are optional, for the sake of understanding):
1. Make spacing more even.
2. Remove camelCase and replace with snake_case
3. Make lines less than 80 chars by using \ to continue lines
4. remove empty returns
5. Correct commenting
6. Improve screen readout for clearer understanding.
7. Python uses pure division so  int/int already gives float, so 100.0 is unnecessary.
8. Replace manual csv writing with 'import csv' module
9. Replace manual file writing with the "with" method.

Changes implemented in the second commit:
10. Implemented unpacking for pairs.
11. Fixed file name from talbe to table
12. Implemented packing of functions with *args and **kwargs
13. Reduced issue with spinlock causing vast resource wastage by only trying to read from fake sensor every 1/4 second instead of as often as possible,
     maybe thousands of times a second. This is the time.sleep(.25) line. This makes a surprising difference. Now my computer fans do not kick up to high 
     gear from running this script!
14. Utilize negative list indexing to go from end of list. i.e list[length-1]  == list[-1]
15. Used tuples in some places instead of just lists.
16. change while loop that used iterator from end of list to instead use "for index, element in enumerate(reversed(list))" notation
17. Changed the output string to f-string style.
