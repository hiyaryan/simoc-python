Changes implemented per suggestions (even if just hints that are optional, for the sake of understanding):
1. Make spacing more even.
2. Remove camelCase and replace with snake_case
3. Make lines less than 80 chars by using \ to continue lines
4. remove empty returns
5. Correct commenting
6. Improve screen readout for clearer understanding.
7. Python uses pure division so  int/int already gives float, so 100.0 is unnecessary.
8. Replace manual csv writing with 'import csv' module
9. Replace manual file writing with the "with" method.

Changes not yet implemented:
1. Use f-strings for strings.
3. While loops convert to for
4. Use unpacking on line 67/68 for current time, val, fakepair
5. Use tuples where a c struct would be used, and lists where arrays would be used firstPair = [startTime, startVal]?
